# EpochHive
A healthy, open source, C# alternative to HiveExt for DayZ Epoch!


My goal for this project is to make Hive more clear, more open-source, and more customisable.
Built upon .NET Framework using C#, my aim is to make the code easy to understand and be developed by the community to fit their needs.

EpochHive will take the SQF Parameters from ArmA 2 OA's callExtension, and serialise them into a DataModel Object which will make development easier, and much clearer to the average developer
